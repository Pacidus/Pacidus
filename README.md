## 🌌 A Sense of Wonder  

*"We make our world significant by the courage of our questions and by the depth of our answers."*
— Carl Sagan

*"Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us."*
— Carl Sagan, *Pale Blue Dot*

I try to keep this sense of wonder alive in everything I work on.
